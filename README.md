Hi, Iâ€™m Ivana â€” a creative problem solver, AI product builder / manager, and community-minded storyteller.

I thrive at the intersection of technology and human connection. Whether Iâ€™m designing AI-powered tools, improving data flows, or mapping strategy across chaos, Iâ€™m driven by one goal: to help people feel more efficient and balanced.

With a background that spans political research, financial institutions, and tech startups, Iâ€™ve learned to navigate ambiguity with curiosity and purpose. I love taking things from 0 to 1 â€” especially when they create real impact and empower others to grow, find ease, and unlock possibility in their own lives.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building AI products that bring clarity, not overwhelm. That support people, not replace them. And that move the world a little closer to harmony â€” one thoughtful decision at a time.
